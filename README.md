# Hi Darker!
Looking for a simple theme to use in your environment?<br><br>
***Maybe you will like this theme that was made taking a little bit of each existing theme, strengths and weaknesses, but it is still not a fully sufficient theme to please our eyes for a long time!***

***I made this theme little by little, seeing which colors would be most pleasing to the eye, and the editor's background was the hardest to find, as I wanted one that would best fit any desktop***
