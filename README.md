# Drkcolor

 Visual studio code theme with strong and saturated colors, adapted for any progamation language.
 Adapted for html and jsx elements with separate colors.

Smooth, saturated colors for development, with a smooth background color close to the vscode pattern

 # In development

 - colors for markdown
 - Possibility to switch between light and dark theme (module color pattern)

 - Better compatibility with Bracket Pair Colorizer (I recommend using with our extension as it is more stylish :) )
