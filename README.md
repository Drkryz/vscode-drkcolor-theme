# Let's code?

![Drkryz Code Force Lets Code](assets/go_to_code.png)
**You can create a new pattern to decorate functions in your code, or differentiate keywords through colors.** <br>
**This is not exclusive to our theme!**
<br><br>

# Do you like these colors?

![Drkryz Code Force Lets Code Menu](assets/go_to_code_menu.png)
**This theme does not have colored borders, the background of all the menus fits together and what sets them apart is their default shadow.** <br>
**I did this to try and fit the look of the editor in any desktop environment**
<br><br>

# Do you like these buttons?

![Drkryz Code Force Lets Code Buttons](assets/go_to_code_buttons.png)
**The theme has a color palette, so I tried to fit all the colors into a single pattern, making a combination of several strong colors.**
<br><br>

## You can contribute the colors too!

![Drkryz Code Force Lets Code Contrib](assets/go_to_code_contribute.png)
**The theme is not mine alone, and from me to the community that seeks comfort at work, and you can contribute to it!**
