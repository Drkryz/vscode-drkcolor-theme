# Drkryz Theme

The Drkryz theme came about as a new color scheme, where everything was very colorful, fun, and the like, where a creator was inspired by beautiful things, not productive ones. In my constant pursuit of improving the theme and trying to fit all the colors so that everything would be comfortable, I may have returned to the bare minimum of the development environment: nothing.

I'm restarting the theme from scratch, based on just a few minimalist colors, searching the internet for what might be comfortable for each user. Version 1.50.0 is the new absolute zero of the drkryz theme, a new proposal.

Drkryz theme is a Visual Studio Code theme built around a simple idea:  
**clean, soft colors that help you stay focused on what really matters â€” your work.**

This theme started as a personal project, inspired by my own taste for calm and minimal color palettes. But it didnâ€™t stop there. Over time, Iâ€™ve refined it based on the feedback and preferences of other developers who share the same need: a coding environment that feels comfortable, distraction-free, and built for long sessions of productivity.

## âœ¨ Why this theme?
  
- Gentle, carefully chosen colors that are easy on the eyes

- A design that supports focus, instead of stealing it
